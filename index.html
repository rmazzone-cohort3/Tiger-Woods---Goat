                    The Grand Slam in golf is where a player has won all 4 of the majors (Masters, US Open, The Open, PGA Championship)
                    Only 5 players, including Tiger have accomplished this. He is the fastest to do it in only 15 starts and is the only player in history to hold all 4 titles at one time, which is now referred to as the "Tiger Slam"
